    "content": "But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\n feverishly the heart of life.  And the revel went whirlingly on, until\n at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock.  And\n then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the\n waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things\n as before.  But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell\n of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought\n crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among\n those who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the\n last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were\n many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of\n the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no\n single individual before.  And the rumour of this new presence having\n spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole\n company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and\n surprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust."
