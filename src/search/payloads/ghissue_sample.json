While I was here, I decided to change the text into tables for each team to make it easier to read (IMHO).  There was no ticket for this request.\r\n\r\n@ACharbonneau , @raynamharris , @sedrie  and anyone else on Team Copper (@dcppc/dcppc-copper-admin?), I would greatly appreciate any feedback.   \r\n\r\nIf no changes are necessary, I can attempt to merge.  Not sure if I have the ability to do so, but I'm happy to try.\noops! I wasn't done yet -_-\nAlso the Copper one isn't right\n"}
