<h1 id="centillion-faq">Centillion FAQ</h1>
<p>This page answers some common questions about centillion, the Data Commons search engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="what-does-centillion-index?">What does centillion index?</h3>
<p>Centillion indexes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Drive files in the Data Commons Google Drive folder (the entire contents of docx files are indexed, while only the metadata is indexed for non-docx files)</li>
<li>Github issues and pull requests (both open and closed) in all of the <a href="https://github.com/dcppc">DCPPC Github organization's</a> Github repositories</li>
<li>Github files (the entire contents of Markdown files are indexed, only the metadata is indexed for non-Markdown files)</li>
<li>Groups.io email threads</li>
<li>Disqus comment threads on the internal DCPPC site, <a href="https://pilot.nihdatacommons.us">https://pilot.nihdatacommons.us</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="what-doesnt-centillion-index?">What doesn't centillion index?</h3>
<p>Centillion utilizes a special DCPPC bot account to access Google Drive files and Github content.
</p>
<p>Centillion <i>does not</i> utilize the Github or Google Drive credentials of <i>any</i> Data Commons users.
</p>
<p>Centillion <i>does not</i> index <i>any</i> content in your personal Github account or your personal Google Drive.
</p>
<p>We respect your privacy!
</p>
<h3 id="how-often-does-centillion-reindex?">How often does centillion re-index?</h3>
<p>We currently re-index centillion on a weekly basis. (We cannot increase the frequency due to API rate limits.)
Re-indexing can also be triggered manually as needed.
</p>
<p>Groups.io email threads are indexed less freqently, since they require a manual step to re-index.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="why-does-centillion-need-my-github-login?">Why does centillion need my Github login?</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that centillion indexes internal and potentailly non-public documents, access to centillion
is limited to members of the Data Commons. To verify a centillion user is a member of the Data Commons, we require
users to log in via Github.com and have Github check if a user is a member of the <a href="https://github.com/dcppc">@dcppc</a>
organization.
</p>
<p><i>At no point</i> does centillion ever handle your Github password.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="how-does-licensing-work?">How does licensing work? Does centillion claim ownership of any content?</h3>
<p>No - centillion does not claim ownership of any content it indexes.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Because the search engine is protected behind a Github authentication layer,
there is no risk of internal, non-public documents being made public (or 
licensed information being released into the wild).
</li>
<li>
Because bot accounts are used to access Google Drive documents and Github
resources, there is no way for centillion to modify the ownership of content.
</li>
<li>
Centillion is a search index, and not a content management system. Documents
are not transferred to centillion or stored as a part of the search index process.
Search results from centillion will link to all original content and make ownership
information clear whenever possible.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="what-information-does-centillion-collect-about-me?">What information does centillion collect about me?</h3>
<p>Centillion logs all queries that users run; these queries are anonymized before they are logged.
Tracking what queries users run helps us improve the quality of centillion and identify trending topics. 
</p>
<p>Centillion will log your IP address as part of the analytics information it collects, but no IP addresses
will be tied to search terms.
